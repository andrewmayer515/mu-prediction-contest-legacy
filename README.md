[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest)

A node.js script that scrapes the contents of [muscoop.com](https://www.muscoop.com/) using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer#readme) to calculate prediction contest winners

## Rules
For this project, I based the prediction contest rules off of [this muscoop.com post](https://www.muscoop.com/index.php?topic=10.0).

Additionally,
* Copy/paste the format in the original post
* All answers must be written next to the question being asked (to the right of the colon)
* If a question asks for a player name, do not use nicknames (use a combination of player first and/or last name)
  * Acceptable: Markus, Howard, Markus Howard, or MHoward
  * Unacceptable: M2N, #0, etc.
* Do not 'Quote' another users prediction

## Setup
Download the latet LTS version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run the following:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest.git
$ cd mu-prediction-contest
$ npm install
```
## Quick Run
After following the setup steps if you want to see how the program works, run the following to get the results from [the 2013 NCAA Tournament game against Davidson](https://www.muscoop.com/index.php?topic=37247.0):
```
$ npm start
```

## Configuration
To configure new prediction contest results, you will need to create a `key.js` file under the src/data folder to enter the postgame results into (refer to [key-example.js](https://github.com/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest/blob/master/src/data/key-example.js) for formatting/location). It may be easier to copy the contents of [key-example.js](https://github.com/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest/blob/master/src/data/key-example.js) into `key.js` to start off.

The results object in `key.js` is comprised of two required parts (Questions and URL) and one that is optional (Bonus).

### Questions
A standard question has 4 main parts: an identifier, text, answer, and the type of question:
```
question1: {
    text: 'Total Game Points:',
    answer: 167,
    type: TYPE.NUMBER,
}
```
#### Identifier
In the example, this is `question1`. Every question will need a unique numerical value after the word 'question'. This is used to parse out the contents of the user comment on the line that starts with '1.'

#### Text
In the example, this is `text: 'Total Game Points:'`. The string here is used on when the app outputs the results.

#### Answer
In the example, this is `answer: 167`. This value will need to be looked up post game for the given question and is used in calculating which user has the closest (or exact) answer to a given question. The formatting of this may be different for different types of questions. Refer to [key-example.js](https://github.com/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest/blob/master/src/data/key-example.js) for examples.

#### Type
In the exaple, this is `type: TYPE.NUMBER`. This designates the type of question being asked. There are currently 3 supported types:
*  `TYPE.NUMBER` - The answer is a number.
*  `TYPE.PLAYER` - The answer is a player name.
*  `TYPE.PLAYER_NUMBER` - The answer is both a player name and a number.

### URL
This is the URL to the [muscoop.com](https://www.muscoop.com/) prediction post where the script will gather data from:
```
url: 'https://www.muscoop.com/index.php?topic=35990.0'
```

### Bonus (Optional)
One question can be given the `bonus` identifier, which marks a question that can be worth a specified number of points. In order for the points to count, a given answer must be exact. It is configured similar to how Questions are configured, plus the `points` option:
```
bonus: {
  answer: 56,
  type: TYPE.NUMBER,
  text: 'Predict Marquette\'s shooting percentage:',
  points: 3,
}
```
#### Points
In the example, this is `points: 3`. This is an override for the amount of points that a Bonus Question is worth. In this example, if the Bonus Question is guessed exactly, 3 points would be awarded to the user(s) that guessed the correct amount. If the `point` option is omitted, a correct response is defaulted to 1 point.

## Run Options

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

Normal usage (headless browser):
```
$ npm start
```

To have the Chromium browser open on launch, you can run the following: 

```
$ node run debug
```

### Login
If you want/need the script to sign in to your [muscoop.com](https://www.muscoop.com/) profile, you can create an `auth.json` file under the src/data folder and provide your username/password (refer to [auth-example.json](https://github.com/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest/blob/master/src/data/auth-example.json) for formatting). You must then append `:login` to the above node script commands:

```
$ node run start:login
```
```
$ node run debug:login
```

## Maintenance
Since some of the questions may refer to an individual player on the roster, the roster found in [src/constants](https://github.com/andrewmayer515/mu-prediction-contest/blob/master/src/constants/index.js) will need to be updated with the player names in a given year.

If a player has a nickname or alias they go by, to have the name included it can be added to the `ALIAS` object. The `key` being the name of the player, `value` being an array of aliases. 

```
ALIAS: {
  'Joseph Chartouny': ['joe c'],
},
```
